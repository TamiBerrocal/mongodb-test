# mongodb-test

Testing Node.js (server) + MongoDB (database) + Mongoose (schema)

To see how it works, clone this repository and start the server by running server.js with **node**: `node server.js`

The server will start on port [5000](http://localhost:5000/)

**NOTE**: The Mongoose schema set for the DB represents dog breeds (sorry, I :heart: dogs)
